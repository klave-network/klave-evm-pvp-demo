Community Certifications: None

Audited by Imperial College London: No

Image and Description: (Provide an image URL or describe a relevant image, e.g., a schematic of the pvp interaction logic, or a placeholder transaction image). A robust Rust-based framework for building decentralized payment-versus-payment interactions on EVM blockchains.

Heading: EVM Payment-Versus-Payment Framework

Subheading summary: A Rust-based framework for creating on-chain PVP interactions on EVM blockchains, emphasizing fairness and decentralization.

Description: This repository offers a Rust-based framework for developing payment-versus-payment (PVP) interactions directly on EVM-compatible blockchains. It provides tools and structures to build trustless and transparent financial interactions.

Features:
    * On-chain interaction logic.
    * Secure and verifiable transactions.
    * Framework for handling payment states and outcomes.
    * Tools for building decentralized payment mechanisms.
    * Rust implementation for performance and safety.
